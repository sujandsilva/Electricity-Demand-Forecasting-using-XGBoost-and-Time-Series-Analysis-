# Electricity-Demand-Forecasting-using-XGBoost-and-Time-Series-Analysis-
In this project, I have developed an SVR model to forecast hourly electricity demand, based on 140,000+ hourly records from 2002 to 2018.                  
I have enhanced prediction accuracy by integrating an XGBoost model, increasing the accuracy from 0.67 to 0.84. I have also visualized electricity consumption trends across different time intervals, identifying key patterns and anomalies
